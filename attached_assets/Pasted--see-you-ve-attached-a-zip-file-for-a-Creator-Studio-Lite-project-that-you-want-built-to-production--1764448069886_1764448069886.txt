 see you've attached a zip file for a Creator Studio Lite project that you want built to production quality using Expo. However, I wasn't able to read the contents of the zip file directly.

To create the best possible plan for your production-ready Expo mobile application, I need to understand what's in your Creator Studio Lite project. Could you help me by:

Describing the main purpose of Creator Studio Lite - what does this app do?
Listing the key features you want included in the production version
Sharing any specific requirements for design, functionality, or integrations
Alternatively, if you can extract and share key files from the zip (like package.json, main screens, or a README), that would help me understand the current state and plan the production build accordingly.

What can you tell me about what Creator Studio Lite should do?

I can see you've provided extensive documentation for a Creator Studio Lite / Amplify Creator Platform project. This is a comprehensive multi-platform content creation and publishing platform built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Supabase.

Let me create a production-ready plan for building this as an Expo mobile application based on the documentation:

App type
Mobile application
A production-ready mobile creator platform for multi-platform content publishing, AI-powered content generation, analytics, and team collaboration
I'll include the following features:

User authentication with Supabase Auth (email/password, profile management)
Content creation studio with media upload and editing
Multi-platform publishing to Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest
AI-powered content idea generation, caption creation, and hashtag suggestions
Analytics dashboard showing views, likes, comments, engagement across platforms
Content scheduling with timezone support and calendar view
Platform connector management (OAuth flows for social media accounts)
Team collaboration with role-based permissions (Owner, Admin, Editor, Viewer)
Media library with categorization and search functionality
Publishing queue with draft/scheduled/published states
Workspace management for multi-tenant support
Push notifications for publishing success/failures and analytics updates

I can see you've provided extensive documentation and code files for the Creator Studio Lite / Amplify platform. Based on all this comprehensive information, I now have a complete picture of what needs to be built.

The plan I already proposed covers the core functionality. Let me know if you'd like me to proceed with that plan, or if you'd like me to adjust anything based on these additional files you've shared.

To move forward, you can:

Approve the plan as-is by clicking the "Approve plan & start" button, and I'll begin building the production-ready Expo mobile application

Request modifications if you'd like me to adjust the MVP features or next phase items based on the detailed documentation you've provided

The current plan includes all the essential features from your documentation:

Multi-platform publishing (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, Pinterest)
AI-powered content generation
Analytics dashboard
Team collaboration with RBAC
Content scheduling
Media management
Supabase authentication and database
Push notifications
